# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

## user_problem_statement: "BDSM (BDS Marble) collective website — React/FastAPI/Mongo. Recent work: (1) Segment-Coloured Purposes — purpose tab highlight rotates through four stone tones (sand/bronze/charcoal/terracotta) so each principle picks up a business colour; (2) Panel Copy Reveal — tagline, tags and buttons fade up from below as each network panel snaps into place. BUG REPORTED BY USER: after the reveal feature, network panels 2, 3, 4 lost their buttons (only panel 1 showed them). Root cause: activation used IntersectionObserver with 0.55 visibility threshold — in short viewports a panel taller than the window never reaches 55% visibility, so it never activated and its copy stayed hidden. Fixed by switching activation to 'panel nearest the viewport centre' (scroll/resize listener in NetworkExperience, /app/frontend/src/App.js)."

Ready for user acceptance with one minor known edge case (panel 1 at short viewport on initial load)."    -agent: "main"
    -message: "New round: (1) ABOUT PAGE WAS COMPLETELY UNSTYLED (0 about-* rules in App.css) — wrote the full stylesheet matching the design system: dark hero w/ radial glow + brass-italic h1 + offset lede, 4-col stats strip w/ hairline dividers, principles hairline card grid (3->1 col), timeline hairline rows w/ acid italic years, team 3-col 4:5 image grid w/ hover zoom, CTA section, full mobile breakpoints. Self-verified desktop + mobile 390x844 (zero horizontal overflow). (2) Fixed invisible CTA buttons: .np-btn--paper was defined BEFORE .np-btn base so equal specificity let the base override it (transparent bg + dark text on dark bg) — added .np-btn.np-btn--paper override; fixed on About AND Experience pages (both now paper bg rgb(244,239,230)). (3) Added 900ms post-mount reveal re-check in NetworkExperience (panel-1 initial-load edge case from testing agent). Needs testing agent confirmation for about page + CTA buttons."

    -message: "✅✅✅ ALL TESTS PASS - ABOUT PAGE FULLY STYLED & CTA BUTTON FIX VERIFIED! Comprehensive testing at desktop 1920x1080 + mobile 390x844 confirms: (1) ABOUT PAGE: Hero section perfect (dark bg with radial gradient, 124px headline with brass/italic second line, kicker row correct, offset lede with 2 paragraphs at 17px font size). Stats strip: all 4 stats (20+, 04, 05, 200+) with hairline left dividers. Principles: 6 cards (data-testid principle-01..06) in 3-col grid with hairline borders, all found. Timeline: 7 items (data-testid timeline-2003..2024) with brass italic years rgb(201,162,98) and hairline separators. Team: 6 cards (data-testid team-1..6) with 4:5 aspect ratio images loading correctly, acid role labels. (2) ✅✅✅ CRITICAL CTA BUTTON FIX VERIFIED: About page button (data-testid about-cta-button) has correct background rgb(244,239,230), is visible, opens contact modal. Experience page button (data-testid experience-book-cta) has correct background rgb(244,239,230), visible over hero image. CSS specificity fix (.np-btn.np-btn--paper override) working perfectly on both pages. (3) MOBILE 390x844: Zero horizontal overflow (body width=390px), all sections stack correctly (stats 2-col, principles 1-col, team 1-col), text readable (H1 52px, lede 17px). (4) REGRESSION CHECKS PASS: All 5 homepage network panels reveal tagline/tags/buttons correctly (h3 opacity=1, both buttons visible opacity=1), Lenis smooth scroll active (html.lenis=true), purpose tabs rotate colors correctly (tab 2=bronze rgb(201,168,136), tab 4=terracotta rgb(217,164,138)), header menu shows '06 AIR BNB', footer shows 'air bnb', both navigate to /experience. User's reported issue (invisible CTA buttons on dark backgrounds) COMPLETELY RESOLVED. Ready for user acceptance."

## agent_communication (Case Study Pages round):
    -agent: "main"
    -message: "CASE STUDY PAGES: The ProjectPage (/projects/:slug) JSX already existed (hero, brief challenge/approach, gallery, outcomes stats, credits, up-next) but had ZERO CSS (same as the About page issue) — rendered as tiny text + full-bleed images. Wrote the complete case-study stylesheet in the dark editorial system with a per-project TONE ACCENT (--cs-tone driven by the project's business/segment tone: sand/bronze/charcoal/terracotta) applied to section labels, the hero dot, gallery/results/credits headings' em, the outcome figures, and the up-next hover. Split hero (copy + 4:3 image), asymmetric 6-col gallery grid, 3-up outcomes stat grid with hairline dividers, hairline credits list, and a large up-next teaser linking to the next project. Self-verified desktop 1920x800 (Marble project = sand accent, Interiors project = terracotta accent rgb(217,164,138) on stats) and mobile 390x844 (all sections stack, zero horizontal overflow). Reachable from every work card in /projects and from each business page's SELECTED PROJECTS mini-grid. Please verify: navigate from a /projects work card into a case study, all 6 sections render styled and readable, gallery images load, outcome stats show, credits list shows, up-next navigates to a different project, VIEW <BUSINESS> link goes to the business page, BACK TO PROJECTS works, and mobile has no overflow. Also confirm tone accent differs across projects of different businesses."

## agent_communication (Mobile animations + footer scroll-top round):
    -agent: "main"
    -message: "USER BUG REPORT (mobile): (1) some animations janky in mobile view, (2) footer 'To the Top' button doesn't reach the hero — it stops at the flooring network panel. FIXES: (a) lib/smoothScroll.js smoothScrollTo now calls snap.stop() before the programmatic glide and snap.start() on completion, plus lock:true — previously a queued lenis/snap proximity snap (debounced 250ms from the last wheel/touch flick) hijacked the scroll-to-0 animation mid-glide and re-targeted it to the nearest panel (the flooring article). (b) NetworkExperience geometric scroll pass is now rAF-throttled (max one getBoundingClientRect batch per frame) to cut mobile layout thrash. (c) App.css: backdrop-filter blur removed from the fixed header at <=800px (solid translucent bar instead) — blurred fixed headers repaint every scroll frame on mobile. PLEASE VERIFY AT MOBILE 390x844: footer 'To the Top' (data-testid=footer-scroll-top) glides all the way to the top hero (final scrollY ~0, hero visible) and does NOT stop at any network/flooring panel; then wheel/touch-scroll down through all 5 network panels and confirm reveal animations still play (h3 + EXPLORE/GET IN TOUCH buttons appear, opacity 1) and rail highlight still tracks; confirm Lenis snap still works for normal wheel scrolling after a programmatic scroll (snap must be restarted); also confirm desktop 1920x800 footer-scroll-top reaches top and header still has frosted blur on desktop but NOT at mobile width."

## agent_communication (Logo white-background removal round):
    -agent: "main"
    -message: "USER BUG: some clientele logos still show white backgrounds in the marquee. Cause: earlier background removal used border-connected flood-fill, which cannot reach white regions ENCLOSED inside logo artwork (mps.png 53.9% opaque white disc, dwps.png 45.9% emblem interior, nhai.png 39.7% block, mangalam.png 20.2% cloud, plus small bits in ~14 others). Fix: applied a global white-key pass on all 24 PNGs in frontend/public/clients/ — pixels near white (min channel 230-255) get alpha keyed by distance-to-white with color un-blending, composited over existing alpha. Post-pass: zero logos have >0.5% opaque white left. Verified via tile simulation that emblems still read correctly on the cream tile. PLEASE VERIFY: homepage -> 'Start a Project' (contact) section bottom -> clientele marquee (data-testid='client-logo-marquee'): NO logo tile shows a white box/patch inside; every logo artwork is still recognizable (especially MPS, DWPS, NHAI, Mangalam, Kshetrapal, JLN crest, Army Cantt badge). Check desktop 1920x800 AND mobile 390x844. Marquee rows 1 and 2 both scroll."

## agent_communication (Mobile network-section sticky-scroll round):
    -agent: "main"
    -message: "USER BUG: network panels section (data-testid='network-section', App.js ~line 397) on mobile view LAGS and panels STICK/snap while scrolling; user wants mobile to scroll normally (no sticky card behaviour) while desktop keeps it. FIX: lib/smoothScroll.js initSmoothScroll now returns {lenis:null,snap:null} when matchMedia('(max-width: 900px)') matches (same breakpoint as the mobile panel CSS at App.css:309) — so on mobile there is NO Lenis smooth-scroll loop and NO lenis/snap panel snapping; scrolling is fully native. smoothScrollTo falls back to window.scrollTo/scrollIntoView (footer 'To the Top' still works). NetworkExperience's snap registration already no-ops when snap is null; reveal logic is scroll-event driven (rAF-throttled) and works with native scroll. Desktop (>900px) unchanged. PLEASE VERIFY: MOBILE 390x844 — scrolling through the network panels feels like a normal page (no snapping/pinning to panel tops, no Lenis glide), window.__smoothScroll should be undefined and html should NOT have the 'lenis' class; panel copy reveal still plays (h3 + EXPLORE/GET IN TOUCH reach opacity 1); footer-scroll-top still returns to top. DESKTOP 1920x800 REGRESSION — html.lenis present, panels still snap to start on wheel scroll, reveals play, footer-scroll-top reaches top."
